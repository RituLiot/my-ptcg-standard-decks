## Thoughts
*Eternatus* has many ways to be built; however, it's very susceptible to *Path to the Peak* (although *Chaotic Swell* helps, you still need to find it, and playing *Guzma & Hala* without good tools is questionable). Another quirk of the archetype is that its damage output is inconsistent. What really works here is the combination of *Weavile-GX* and *Max Potion*, and *Black Market* is also a great card to include and can single-handedly win you games. Overall, you can cook, but I'm not sure if it'll be good enough.
