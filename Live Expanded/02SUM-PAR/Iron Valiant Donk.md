## Thoughts
Straight up cancer. You either win T1 going first, or your opponent plays __two__ hefty minions, and you concede. *Scoop Up Net* is a stupid card, and this deck perfectly encapsulates that. Despite that, I like the unique gameplay this deck offers — a great puzzle in sequencing. It is a one-time puzzle, as after you solve it, you can replicate the solution almost perfectly every time, but still.
