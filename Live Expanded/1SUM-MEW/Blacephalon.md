## Thoughts
This deck is really good against Stage 1 two-prizers — and kinda sucks against everything else. You need 6 energies against Stage 2 exs, and against single-prizers that take multiple prizes you cry. Maybe you could add some stuff to deal with both — *Welder* engine is a good one after all.
