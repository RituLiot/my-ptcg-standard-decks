## Thoughts
I don't think *Vespiqueen ex* is playable. 200 for 3 is mid, and 3 damage counters to damaged mons cost literally 0 energy (looking at you, *Hisuian Braviary*). And the hoops you need to jump through to setup this disappointing strategy are ridiculous. At least 8 cards and loss of a three-prizer — at this point you're just begging to lose.
