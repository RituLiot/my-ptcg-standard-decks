## Thoughts
This one falls apart really quickly. You can get countered in so many ways that it's not even funny. 4 energies required for a hit-and-run attack is ridiculous (although 160 is a nice two-shotting number most of the time), and doll stalling is meaningless with *Boss*/*Guzma* in the format. Don't play this.
