## Thoughts
Now that's a deck I can get behind. Can do literally anything with almost no setup required and can tech for literally anything. You're not that scared of *Path to the Peak* with *Marshadow* in play, but you're afraid of bench size limiting effects. Probably the best deck in the format, but that requires more testing.
